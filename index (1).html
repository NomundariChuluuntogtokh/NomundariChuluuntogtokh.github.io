        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, my name is Nomundari Chuluuntogtokh and I am a first year Psychology student at UC Riverside. Throughout my highschool experience, I have volunteered in various organizations including foodbanks, medical supply sorting, and more. I have worked at a number of organizations during my time in high school, such as food banks and medical supply sorting, which has greatly influenced how I view community service and my desire to work in the medical field. I gained firsthand knowledge of the difficulties many families encounter in obtaining necessary nutrition through my work as a food bank volunteer. I discovered the value of organization and teamwork while sorting and distributing food. As I coordinated our efforts with other volunteers, I not only assisted with food package preparation but also honed my communication skills. I gained a great deal of empathy from interacting with families that used these services, and it reaffirmed the notion that even seemingly insignificant deeds of kindness can make a big difference.<br><br>

        I also gained an appreciation for the vital function that medical resources play in patient care as a result of my work sorting medical supplies. I learned about different supplies and their importance in healthcare settings while helping to organize and distribute donated medical equipment. My attention to detail improved as a result of this experience, and I learned how crucial it is to make sure that everything is appropriately organized and used. Beyond these particular responsibilities, volunteering has helped me understand the importance of advocacy and community involvement. I was able to spread knowledge about the healthcare services that are accessible, with a focus on education and preventive care, by taking part in health fairs and outreach initiatives. My interest in raising health awareness in marginalized populations was piqued by these encounters, which also improved my communication abilities. All things considered, my volunteer work has deepened my appreciation for compassion and service, inspiring me to seek a profession in healthcare where I can make a meaningful impact on people's lives. I'm excited to keep expanding my radiologic technology-related work experience. at order to improve my abilities and obtain practical experience with imaging technology, I am actively looking for internship or employment opportunities at medical facilities. By using cutting-edge imaging technology, I hope to improve patient care and give medical practitioners precise diagnostic assistance.<br><br>

        I am actively looking for possibilities to intern or work in medical institutions since I am excited to continue expanding my professional expertise in the field of radiologic technology. My development as a prospective MRI technician depends on gaining practical experience, and I think that working in a clinical setting will enable me to put my academic knowledge to use while picking the brains of seasoned specialists. Internships that expose me to a variety of imaging technologies and techniques really interest me. I am aware that every imaging modality has a distinct function in patient care, and working with a medical team will give me important knowledge about how these tools are applied to diagnosis and care. I'm excited to work with radiologists and other medical professionals to gain a deeper comprehension of the diagnostic procedure and the role that imaging plays in patient care. I also want to improve critical abilities including safety procedures, equipment operation, and patient engagement. Since many patients may experience anxiety during imaging treatments, I am dedicated to creating a kind and encouraging environment for them. I intend to improve patient care while gaining competence and confidence in my technical skills by immersing myself in a professional environment. I will be much more prepared for a prosperous career in radiologic technology because to this hands-on experience.
